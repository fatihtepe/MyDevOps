[AWS Solution Architect Professional ‚Äî Exam tips -2021](https://medium.com/startcloudnow/aws-solution-architect-professional-exam-tips-2021-9dee760f20ec)

I recently had to recertify my AWS Solution Architect Professional exam. AWS is very nice in that they give you three years to recertify. Even though it‚Äôs three years preparing for recertification can be stressful. If you choose not to recertify I can understand but if you plan on keeping it well let just say on AWS a lot of things change fast.

My preparation for this exam was very very stressful mainly because I had done a series of exams in December 2020 and this was my first for 2021 so my brain needed a rest. This exam is the real deal it covers the full gambit. From my experience, this is the rabbit hole I had to face. It covered topics like, storage, analytics, networking, compute, database types, migration, security both services and policy, serverless, Amazon FSx, API stuff, Appsec, Organisations, IAM, and more.

[AWS Solutions Architect: Exam Question Deep Dive](https://codeburst.io/aws-solutions-architect-exam-question-deep-dive-d9ea49479a11)

As I have prepared for AWS exams, I found dissecting exam questions helpful to grow my AWS knowledge. This post is a bite-sized study guide that will hopefully expand your knowledge of AWS and help you on your journey to becoming a Solutions Architect as well.

For each post in this series, I am choosing one AWS Solutions Architect Professional exam question. We will explore the required knowledge and strategy to find the right answer and learn about a few AWS services along the way.

[AWS Application Load Balancer algorithms](https://medium.com/dazn-tech/aws-application-load-balancer-algorithms-765be2eca158)

All load balancers support some balancing algorithms. These algorithms define which target handles each request. They‚Äôre often ignored, but choosing the correct balancing algorithm can have a big impact on your application performance. The most common algorithms are round-robin and least connections, known as Least Outstanding Requests by AWS. Let‚Äôs take a look at how each of these work.


[CloudWatch vs CloudTrail](https://digitalcloud.training/cloudwatch-vs-cloudtrail-comparison/)

`Two of the most important ‚ÄúCloud‚Äù services to know for your exam are Amazon CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail`. You may have already heard of these services before because they‚Äôre quite popular on AWS (for a good reason). They‚Äôre popular because they both perform a very important function. With ‚ÄúWatch‚Äù and ‚ÄúTrail‚Äù at the end of the name, can you guess what essential function it is that they perform?

You got it, monitoring!

[A Cloud Migration Questionnaire for Solution Architects](https://betterprogramming.pub/a-cloud-migration-questionnaire-for-solution-architects-dec7ffcf063e#28dc)

Many companies operating from their own data centers started migrating their applications to the cloud, and it has become an obvious choice for many startups to create cloud-native applications. This is most important because of the speed of time to market and cost-efficiency in addition to many other benefits of the cloud.

As a solution architect, you need to ask relevant questions to gather the required information from customers. The solution you build based on this information from the customer lays the foundation for future design solutions and migrations.

[AWS Solution Architect Associate Exam Study Notes
](https://chloemcateer.medium.com/aws-solution-architect-associate-exam-study-notes-b6c5884ee500)

While studying for my exam I created a tonne of notes to break down and understand all of the different services.
Before sitting the exam, I took my notes and created high level summaries for each service and I have decided to share each of these summaries through blogs!

One thing to note is that these are just overall summaries, so I would not recommend solely using these for your studies, but to use as an overview or as some reading to do the week of your exam.

[AWS ‚Äî Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) Overview](https://medium.com/awesome-cloud/aws-elastic-load-balancer-elb-overview-introduction-to-aws-elb-alb-nlb-gwlb-e2820fe8fe27)

AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) automatically distributes your incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, in one or more Availability Zones. It monitors the health of its registered targets, and routes traffic only to the healthy targets. Elastic Load Balancing scales your load balancer as your incoming traffic changes over time. It can automatically scale to the vast majority of workloads.

[Preparing For AWS Interview Questions](https://neal-davis.medium.com/preparing-for-aws-interview-questions-ac493da5f60a)

[5 AWS Services You Should Avoid!](https://medium.com/teamzerolabs/5-aws-services-you-should-avoid-f45111cc10cd)

Get ready for some personal and definitely opinionated opinions!
AWS comes with many components that cover different areas of concerns. But, most are not general purpose and cheap enough to be applied correctly. Used in the wrong context, they end up wasting time, resources, money, and will create developer friction and frustrations for months.

Here are the top 5 AWS Services you should avoid:
- Cognito
- CloudFormation
- ElasticCache
- Kinesis
- Lambda

[How to pass AWS Solutions Architect Professional Exam?](https://medium.com/@talhaocakci/how-to-pass-aws-solutions-architect-professional-exam-87bebfdae86f)

First things first: Passing the exam does not mean you are a solutions architect. Second, the real target is to be a solutions architect, not a plain certificate holder. So, a certificate may be required but not sufficient for real job.

If we agree on it, we may talk about the details of both exam and AWS environment and how AWS certification exam evaluates you. By the way, I have prepared for the associate exam with this course. I highly recommend it.

I‚Äôve used a lot of AWS services lately, and I‚Äôve come across multiple interesting services in AWS.
Most of them are related to cost management&saving, and security.

[AWS CloudFormation: Create a VPC with EC2 Instance](https://aws.plainenglish.io/aws-cloudformation-create-a-vpc-with-ec2-instance-34e27d59a842)

AWS CloudFormation, an Infrastructure as Code service, includes a template made up of nine sections. Although made up of nine sections, the Resources section is the only one required. For this project we will be using Mappings, Resources, and Outputs. I‚Äôve broken my template down to explain what is going on in each section, but if you want to jump straight to the full CloudFormation Template feel free to skip to the end.

[S3 vs EBS vs EFS ‚Äî Comparing AWS Storage Services](https://neal-davis.medium.com/s3-vs-ebs-vs-efs-comparing-aws-storage-services-76080002cb49)

AWS offers many services, so many that it can often get pretty confusing for beginners and experts alike. This is especially true when it comes to the many storage options AWS provides its users. Knowing the benefits and use cases of AWS storage services will help you design the best solution. In this article, we‚Äôll be looking at S3 vs EBS vs EFS.

[Managing Temporary AWS Console Access](https://towardsaws.com/managing-temporary-aws-console-access-169b1f331e79)

Recently we had a scenario where we need to allow developers access to the parameter store so that they can check and update the parameters. Since developers may not be that comfortable working with AWS CLI, we decided to generate temporary IAM users with console access. In this post, we‚Äôll see how we can create these temporary users and then delete them after some time.

[AWS ‚Äî Site-to-Site VPN Connections Overview](https://medium.com/awesome-cloud/aws-site-to-site-vpn-connections-overview-introduction-to-aws-vpn-getting-started-ba889c2f1849)

AWS VPN solutions establish secure connections between your on-premises networks, remote offices, client devices, and the AWS global network. You can extend your on-premises networks to the cloud and securely access them from anywhere.

[Disaster Recovery vs. Backups ‚Äî What‚Äôs the Difference?](https://aws.plainenglish.io/what-we-misunderstand-about-disaster-recovery-and-backups-32d89e3cae77)

The key for you to take away is that these two have entirely different use cases, two different goals. So, solving your disaster problem cannot be done with backups, and disaster recovery is not a backup of your production system. You can‚Äôt just have a disaster recovery site and assume that that is good enough. Your disaster recovery site should be taking backups of the data that lives within it, so in the event of a huge disaster where your streaming is interrupted or corrupted, you have a proper backup. I mean, host failures can also happen in a disaster recovery site just like they can happen in a production site.

[Top 7 Serverless AWS Services](https://aws.plainenglish.io/top-7-serverless-aws-services-db8fab3d5901)

What is Serverless?
Serverless is a development model that allows us to build and run applications‚Ä¶

The biggest advantage of this approach is that you pay only for the compute power, storage, and other resources you use without any up-front commitments. Also, your application can scale up based on demand. You have access to compute and storage resources when you need them.

Although there are a lot of services available, there are only 7 core services to build a serverless application:
- API Gateway ‚Äî API, REST API
- Lambda ‚Äî Logic, Execute code
- DynamoDB ‚Äî Data, Store & - - Retrieve Data
- Cognito ‚Äî Auth, Authenticate Users
- S3 ‚Äî App, Serve static app
- CloudFront ‚Äî Cache, Improve Performance with Caching
- Route 53 ‚Äî DNS, Translate URL

[Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service): Quick Overview and Tutorial](https://blog.iron.io/amazon-sqs-simple-queue-service-overview-and-tutorial/)

Queues are a powerful way of combining software architectures. They allow for asynchronous communication between different systems, and are especially useful when the throughput of the systems is unequal.   Amazon offers their version of queues with Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service).

For example, if you have something like:

- System A - produces messages periodically in huge bursts
- System B - consumes messages constantly, at a slower pace

[The Absolute minimum every developer must know about AWS Security!](https://faun.pub/the-absolute-minimum-every-developer-must-know-about-aws-security-7b448a10570a)

The cloud is becoming increasingly popular in our day and age. It is the driving force of the modern world, and engineers are starting to shift their careers accordingly. Whatever your profession, chances are that you will have to work with the cloud in some way or another. Terms such as VPCs, subnets, security groups, ECS, and so on will no longer sound unfamiliar. But have we really grasped the gravity of this seismic shift?

[15 AWSome years of Amazon EC2 and still going strong!](https://medium.com/workfall/15-awsome-years-of-amazon-ec2-and-still-going-strong-fcc7916955ca)

This year marks the 15th anniversary of Amazon EC2(Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud), marking a landmark milestone for both the firm and the computing industry it serves.

[AWS Basics: Security Groups vs NACL](https://aws.plainenglish.io/aws-basics-security-groups-vs-nacl-826de14c2bc1)

The AWS VPC network layer can be protected with Security Group and with NACL (Network ACL). These constructs provide a ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù functionality. Hence it becomes the confusing to understand which one should to use.
First point to understand is that these are complementing constructs. Which means you should use both of them. Together these form a ‚ÄúSwiss cheese model‚Äù.

[Protect your Infrastructure with Real-time Notifications of AWS Console User Changes](https://towardsdatascience.com/protect-your-infrastructure-with-real-time-notifications-of-aws-console-user-changes-3144fd18c680)

You‚Äôve embraced infrastructure as code (IoC) and painstakingly created Terraform or CloudFormation to model your EC2 Instances, AutoScaling Groups, ECS clusters, and everything else. The devops and development teams have committed to only modify and create infrastructure using your chosen IoC tools ‚Äî but, surprise, some people just won‚Äôt comply. Maybe someone gets lazy during feature development or takes a shortcut during incident response. Maybe you‚Äôve outsourced your level one support and you don‚Äôt entirely trust that group yet. Whatever the reason, you would love to know when a user logs in to the AWS Console web site and manually changes things.
