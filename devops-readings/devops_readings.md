[Discovering AWS](https://adayinthelifeof.nl/2020/05/20/aws.html)

You might realise that it’s probably near impossible to dive into
each service and completely understand how they work and most likely,
you don’t really need to know the exact ins and outs. But, having a basic
understanding on each service can be a major benefit as a developer, architect
or administrator. It makes it easier to see if there is an already existing solution
for your problem at hand.

So, I dove into each and every service to figure out what it
exactly was for and how it works in the basics. I tried to
experiment with as many components as possible (time and
money permitting, I didn’t want to spend 15.000$ on
AWS Data Exchange). I tried to capture what the
service does in a single one-liner to give
you a global overview.

I think most of them are correct enough but if you have any suggestions
or corrections, please tell me!

[How To: Become Invisible on the Web Using Linux](https://medium.com/upskilling/how-to-become-invisible-on-the-web-using-linux-dc86ef12ab51)

‘Tails’ is a Debian based Linux distribution renowned by Edward Snowden for is privacy capabilities. With a simple design, it is very easy to use by anyone and offers a host of security features preinstalled to make your online experience totally anonymous. Note that Tails is 100% dedicated to online privacy, and is not a suitable for gaming, media production, office work, or casual use. The best way to get the most out of Tails is by downloading it onto a ‘bootable’ USB key and plugging it into any public or private computer to instantly become invisible wherever you go.
The main safeguard put in place by this distro is the TOR network. TOR hides your IP address by randomly running your data through a series of TOR nodes before hitting the main server. That way, if the server company wants to see your IP all they will see is the last node that the TOR ran through (which is some random IP not connected to you). Also, all of your data sent through TOR is encrypted, so anyone listening in on your data stream will only see gibberish.

[The Complete DevOps RoadMap](https://medium.com/hackernoon/the-2018-devops-roadmap-31588d8670cb)

DevOps is really hot at the moment and most of my friends, colleagues, and senior developers I know are working hard to become a DevOps engineer and project themselves as DevOps champion in their organization.
While I truly acknowledge the benefits of DevOps, which is directly linked to improved software development and deployment, from my limited experience I can say that it’s not an easy job. It’s very difficult to choose the right path in the middle of so many tools and practices.
Being a Java blogger, many of my readers often ask me questions like how to become a DevOps engineer, which tools should I learn? which practices should I follow? does learning Maven and Jenkins must for a DevOps guy? how about Docker and Kubernetes? Does the infrastructure automation part of DevOps? should I learn Chef, Puppet, or Ansible are just some of those questions which keep coming to me.


[Differences Between Junior DevOps and Senior DevOps Engineers](https://medium.com/devops-dudes/differences-between-junior-devops-and-senior-devops-engineers-8d0f28b8b30b)

DevOps is a culture that encourages collaborations among all stakeholders including development and operations teams and the improvement of processes through automation to increase the quality and speed of software delivery.
While DevOps heavily emphasizes the need for cultural change within a company, the industry has most definitely adopted a job title for “DevOps Engineer.” As with most job titles and roles within a company, there are usually junior, experienced, and senior members that focus on that role.


[DevOps Is Dead, Long Live NoOps](https://medium.com/devopscurry/is-devops-still-a-good-career-choice-in-2021-293f8a5a36df)

[The Evolution of CI/CD](https://medium.com/the-devops-corner/the-evolution-of-ci-cd-763df723f05b)

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery have become a staple of any competent software house. They have become the lifeblood of the team and the engine that drives changes out into production.
Modern CI/CD solutions are all singing, all dancing masters of delivery. They come packed with useful, funky features. Yet, it’s easy to forget that the origins of CI/CD were very humble. This article is a high-level look at how CI/CD has changed over the years, to give a perspective of the direction of travel.

[YAML Tutorial: Get Started With YAML in 5 Minutes](https://betterprogramming.pub/yaml-tutorial-get-started-with-yaml-in-5-minutes-549d462972d8)

YAML is a data serialization language that allows you to store complex data in a compact and readable format. It’s important for DevOps and virtualization because it’s essential in making efficient data management systems and automation.

[What is GitOps?](https://www.gitops.tech/)


GitOps is a way of implementing Continuous Deployment for cloud native applications. It focuses on a developer-centric experience when operating infrastructure, by using tools developers are already familiar with, including Git and Continuous Deployment tools.

The core idea of GitOps is having a Git repository that always contains declarative descriptions of the infrastructure currently desired in the production environment and an automated process to make the production environment match the described state in the repository. If you want to deploy a new application or update an existing one, you only need to update the repository - the automated process handles everything else. It’s like having cruise control for managing your applications in production.

[The Modern DevOps Toolbox](https://medium.com/akava/the-modern-devops-toolbox-part-1-of-3-5d5c317052b0)
DevOps. Is it just a buzzword? A collection of software tools? A job title? Unfortunately, one of the most critical facets of DevOps often gets lost in the noise and debate about what it really “is”. More importantly: what is the goal of Devops?
For enterprises that want to succeed at DevOps, this goal should be at the forefront of any software choice, engineering hire, or process change. Simply put: the goal of DevOps is to holistically enable engineering teams and organizations to deploy applications and software faster, easier, and safer.

[State of DevOps](https://medium.com/@testep02/state-of-devops-84203fe48d6f)

I have been fortunate in my career to have had the perfect blend of experience to land in a DevOps role. I spent nearly 15 years as a software engineer and another 4 as a Scrum Master. When I was asked to take on the lead DevOps role of a startup, I had no idea what I was getting into. I had never heard of DevOps.

[Introduction to DevOps](https://phifertoo.medium.com/introduction-to-devops-cca34e3f4523)

Whenever I hear DevOps, I think about deployments. Many people have different definitions and interpretations of DevOps. In my opinion, DevOps is simply a paradigm to improve the development lifecycle.

[DevOps In Simple English](https://plazagonzalo.medium.com/elastic-load-balancers-342c1a14d69a)

Shared responsibility among stakeholders is a key attribute of DevOps. When all parties are involved from conception through development, and throughout the lifetime of software they have an all-around knowledge of the whole process. This would help the developers improve logging and automate deployment better and adopt new automation tools and practices by engineers.

[Migrating Jenkins on AWS using Terraform](https://devunderslash.medium.com/migrating-jenkins-on-aws-using-terraform-2917590505f1)

This is a rundown of how I recently moved one of our Jenkins instances that was sitting on a repurposed AWS EC2 instance doing multiple jobs and serving many other purposes.

[DevOps Engineer is the new SysAdmin](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/devops-engineer-is-the-new-sysadmin-5bc46b86d413)

DevOps Engineer seems to be a job title that causes a fair amount of confusion. Perhaps this is because it’s an anti-pattern. Apparently, a lot of companies think they can hire someone and suddenly become DevOps. They want to “change” without actually changing anything! (except to change the title of “SysAdmin” to “DevOps Engineer”). ;-)


[Migrating To Serverless — Big Business Benefits For Established Companies](https://towardsaws.com/migrating-to-serverless-big-business-benefits-for-established-companies-ee6e269e74b2)

What is serverless? Serverless is a cloud computing model that was first introduced by AWS in 2014 (AWS Lambda is the market leader to this day). It abstracts away most of the server operations to the cloud provider so developers can only focus on writing code and shipping new features. Serverless adoption is rapidly growing and it’s mostly due to it’s promise of providing significant cost and time efficiency for technology companies.
