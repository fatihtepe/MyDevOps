[Kubernetes explained deep enough](https://itnext.io/kubernetes-explained-deep-enough-1ea2c6821501)<br>
Why another Kubernetes series?
As the popularity of Kubernetes grows, so does the number of great online resources and learning materials. A lot of available information is either designed for absolute beginners or does a very deep dive into a specific topic.<br>

My goal is to write about Kubernetes topics in a practical way, like storage, deployments, services etc and provide exercises scenarios for everyone to follow along. The idea is to focus on the core functionality, understand it well enough and exercise along. If you already watched a few tutorials and maybe created pod or deployment and are ready for the next level, this series is for you.

[Network Service in Kubernetes](https://iceburn.medium.com/network-service-in-kubernetes-a57ef808527)

Kubernetes network service related components
The network service related components of k8s are further divided into the following categories.
- Load Balancer / Ingress: Load balancer (LB), Ingress is a layer that receives communication from outside the cluster and transfers it into the cluster. In particular, LB is “outside the cluster”, so it is often placed separately from K8s. Or the component of Ingress may also be the LB.

- DNS / Service Discovery: Performs name resolution and monitoring of pods and containers inside the cluster . It is a traffic control role in the cluster. In k8s, it’s usually a component of DNS and service discovery rather than DNS alone.

- CNI: A component that supports the Container Network Interface (CNI), which tunnels communication between containers.
Service mesh: A service mesh is a system that can comprehensively and centrally manage pods and services by combining any of the above.

[Kubernetes — Ingress Overview
](https://medium.com/devops-mojo/kubernetes-ingress-overview-what-is-kubernetes-ingress-introduction-to-k8s-ingress-b0f81525ffe2)

In Kubernetes, an Ingress is an object that allows access to Kubernetes services from outside the Kubernetes cluster. You can configure access by creating a collection of rules that define which inbound connections reach which services.

An Ingress can be configured to give Services externally-reachable URLs, load balance traffic, terminate SSL/TLS, and offer name-based virtual hosting. Ingress lets you configure an HTTP load balancer for applications running on Kubernetes, represented by one or more Kubernetes internal Services.

[Kubernetes Fundamentals For Absolute Beginners: Architecture & Components](https://medium.com/the-programmer/kubernetes-fundamentals-for-absolute-beginners-architecture-components-1f7cda8ea536)

K8s is a production-grade open-source container orchestration tool developed by Google to help you manage the containerized/dockerized applications supporting multiple deployment environments like On-premise, cloud, or virtual machines.

[Kubernetes in Action !!
](https://faun.pub/kubernetes-in-action-dec7c0583b7)

Kubernetes: History Overview
When docker manages the microservices and containers, a container management system became a paramount requirement for all organizations and individuals, during time Google was already working on the project and opensource the project called Borg. To enchase the container management system company came up with the Kubernetes, an open-source project to automate the process of deploying and managing the multi-cloud application at scale.

[Kubernetes Journey — Basic Linux commands you should know](https://itnext.io/kubernetes-journey-basic-linux-commands-you-should-know-da4f95ceca5)

If you are starting to get into Kubernetes, and don't know basic Linux commands yet, you should probably learn how to walk before you can run. Take my advice and read this blog until you learn these commands, and it will accelerate your learning.

[Kubernetes: Apprentice Cookbook](https://aveuiller.medium.com/kubernetes-apprentice-cookbook-90d8c11ccfc3)

You probably already heard of Kubernetes, a powerful orchestrator that will ease deployment and automatically manage your applications on a set of machines, called a Cluster.

With great power comes great complexity, even in the eyes of Google. Thus, learning Kubernetes is oftentimes considered as cumbersome and complex, namely because of the number of new concepts you have to learn. On the other hand, those very same concepts can be found in other orchestrators. As a result, mastering them will ease your onboarding on other orchestrators, such as Docker Swarm.

[Learnings From Two Years of Kubernetes in Production](https://lambda.grofers.com/learnings-from-two-years-of-kubernetes-in-production-b0ec21aa2814)

Almost two years back, we took the decision to leave behind our Ansible based configuration management setup for deploying applications on EC2 and move towards containerisation and orchestration of applications using Kubernetes. We have migrated most of our infrastructure to Kubernetes. It was a big undertaking and had its own challenges — from technical challenges of running a hybrid infrastructure until most of the migration is done to training the entire team on a completely new paradigm of operations to name a few.

[10 Reasons why Kubernetes is a Good Idea](https://aws.plainenglish.io/10-reasons-why-kubernetes-is-a-good-idea-9b3990ef7fb1)

[Kubernetes Imperative Commands Every Engineer Should Learn](https://blog.devgenius.io/kubernetes-imperative-commands-every-engineer-should-learn-3b5d8217fa29)

When working with kubernetes, you will mostly be creating objects in a declarative way using YAML definition files.
However, imperative commands can help in getting one time tasks done quickly, as well as generating definition file templates easily, saving a considerable amount of time.

A Lens which will make you a Kubernetes Superman
As I was working recently on Kubernetes especially on minikube as were using it for the production environment.
I was really frustrated with the fact that minikube dashboard is very bad and lacking many features. Also, I was using the minikube Kube config file to manage resources…
For DevOps engineers, there is a constant struggle while debugging errors on Kubernetes.

[Kubernetes Deep Dive: Service and Ingress](https://aws.plainenglish.io/kubernetes-deep-dive-service-and-ingress-541ea3a70544)

k8s Ingress is an API object that manages external access to the services in a cluster. Ingress exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster. Traffic routing is controlled by rules defined on the Ingress resource. Below is a simple example:

[RancherOS](https://github.com/rancher/os/blob/master/README.md/#user-content-amazon)

The smallest, easiest way to run Docker in production at scale. Everything in RancherOS is a container managed by Docker. This includes system services such as udev and rsyslog. RancherOS includes only the bare minimum amount of software needed to run Docker. This keeps the binary download of RancherOS very small. Everything else can be pulled in dynamically through Docker.
