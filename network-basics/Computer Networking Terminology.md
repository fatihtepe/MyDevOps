<a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml">IANA</a><br>
Service names and port numbers are used to distinguish between different
services that run over transport protocols such as TCP, UDP, DCCP, and
SCTP.

Service names are assigned on a first-come, first-served process, as
documented in [RFC6335].

Port numbers are assigned in various ways, based on three ranges: System
Ports (0-1023), User Ports (1024-49151), and the Dynamic and/or Private
Ports (49152-65535); the difference uses of these ranges is described in
[RFC6335]. According to Section 8.1.2 of [RFC6335], System Ports are 
assigned by the "IETF Review" or "IESG Approval" procedures described in 
[RFC8126]. User Ports are assigned by IANA using the "IETF Review" process, 
the "IESG Approval" process, or the "Expert Review" process, as per 
[RFC6335]. Dynamic Ports are not assigned.

The registration procedures for service names and port numbers are
described in [RFC6335].

Assigned ports both System and User ports SHOULD NOT be used without
or prior to IANA registration.<br>

<a href="https://www.webopedia.com/reference/well-known-tcp-port-numbers/">LIST OF WELL-KNOWN PORTS</a><br>
Port numbers 0 to 1024 are reserved for privileged services and designated as well-known ports. This list of port numbers are specified in RFC 1700.<br>
- In TCP/IP and UDP networks, a port is an endpoint to a logical connection and the way a client program specifies a specific server program on a computer in a network. The port number identifies what type of port it is. For example, port 80 is used for HTTP traffic. Some ports have numbers that are assigned to them by the IANA, and these are called the “well-known ports” which are specified in RFC 1700.
- Port numbers range from 0 to 65535, but only port numbers 0 to 1023 are reserved for privileged services and designated as well-known ports. 

* Well-known ports range from 0 through 1023.
 
* Registered ports are 1024 to 49151.

* Dynamic ports (also called private ports) are 49152 to 65535.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNa97A08wyU">FIBER-OPTIC CABLE</a><br>
A type of cable that contains one or more optical fibers that are used to carry light. Optical fiber is a very thin strand of pure glass that acts as a waveguide for light over long distances. Fiber optic cable is actually composed of two layers of glass: The core which is thinner than hair carries the actual light signal, and the cladding is a layer of a glass surrounding the core. There are two types of optic cables: SMF and MMF

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNa97A08wyU">SMF</a><br>
SMF stands for Single-Mode Fiber. SMF has a very narrow core which allows only a single mode of light to propagate. 

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNa97A08wyU">MMF</a><br>
MMF stands for Multi-Mode Fiber. MMF has a much wider core, allowing multiple modes(or "rays") of light ot propagate.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mad4kQ5835Y">MODEM</a> <br>
Modem demodulates incoming analog signals into a digital signal. Modem modulates outgoing digital signals into an analog signal.<br>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mad4kQ5835Y">ROUTER</a> <br>
A router is what routes or passes your internet connection to all of your devices. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1z0ULvg_pW8&t=129s">Router </a>routes data from one network to another based on their IP address. A layer 3 (Network) device: separates collision domains, separates broadcast domains, forward IP packets across different networks, No routers, no Internet.<br>
* Routers can have many different names: Layer 3 switch and multilayer switch are the most common, besides the name router, of course. Remember, if you hear just the word switch, that means a Layer 2 device. Routers, Layer 3 switches, and multilayer switches are all Layer 3 devices.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mad4kQ5835Y">MODEM/ROUTER DEVICE</a> <br>
A modem/router device would have a modem with a built-in wireless router, in one device. 

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKCDLk9irkQ">SIMPLEX</a> <br>
Simplex is when signals travel in one direction and one direction only.(TV, radio, garage door, car key fob, wireless microphone)

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKCDLk9irkQ">HALF-DUPLEX</a> <br>
Half-duplex transmission is when signals travel in both directions, but one at a time. Both trasnmitter and receiver can send signals, but they must take turns. One example is walkie-talkie.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKCDLk9irkQ">FULL-DUPLEX</a> <br>
Full-duplex is two-way communications and signals travel in both directions simultaneously. (Telephone)<br>
* Hubs and Switches are used to exchange data within a local area network. Not used to exchange data outside their own network. To exchange data outside their own network, a device needs to be able to read I.P. adresses.  We need router!

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1z0ULvg_pW8&t=129s">HUB</a> <br>
Only detects that a device is physically connected to it.Data is copied to all other ports.Creates unnecessary traffic.Security! A layer 1 (Physical) device: One collision domain one broadcast domain. All nodes share the bandwith of network.Hub does not perform any filtration which means that each chunk of data is transmitted to all the connected end devices even if it is not a destined device.
* Hubs are sometimes called multiport repeaters.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck3gx9HB9-k">COLLISION DOMAIN</a><br>
In an Ethernet network, a collision domain a group of nodes that can hear each other. Collisions occur when two noedes on a shared network segment send packets simultaneously.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1z0ULvg_pW8&t=129s">SWITCH</a> <br>
Can detect specific devices that are connected to it. Keeps a record of the MAC addresses of those devices.
Switch is intelligent. Stores physical addresses. DAta directed only to intended port. Reduces unnecessary traffic. A layer 2 (Data Link) device: separates collision domains, creates a broadcast domain, gives every conversation the full bandwith of the network.<br>
* A hub acts as a multiport repeater. However, as more and more devices connect to it, it would not be able to efficiently manage the volume of traffic that passes through it. A switch provides a better alternative that can improve the performance especially when high traffic volume is expected across all ports.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck3gx9HB9-k">BROADCAST DOMAIN</a><br>
A broadcast domain is a collection of network devices that recieve broadcast traffic from each other. A broadcast means that we send someting that everyone receives, whether they need/want it or not. Any node using 12F (MAC address: FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF) is broadcasting. Any other node can hear broadcast.

PDU <br>
“PDU (Protocol Data Unit)”. Irrespective of whether you are talking about network layer, transport layer or physical layer, the term PDU is generic and applies to all.

SEGMENT <br>
PDU at Transport layer is called as segments. Port numbers are part of Segments.

PACKET <br>
PDU at network layer is called as Packet. IP addresses are part of a Packet.

FRAME <br>
PDU at data link layer is called as Frame. MAC addresses are part of Frames.

BITS <br>
The Physical layer receives the frames and converts them into bits to be put on the network medium.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=778rS_FMb10"> NIC </a> <br>
A: NIC is short for Network Interface Card. This is a peripheral card that is attached to a PC in order to connect to a network. Every NIC has its own MAC address that identifies the PC on the network. The NIC is called a Layer 2 device because the information it uses for communication, the MAC address, resides on the Data Link layer. 


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBlJ3QuEt9k"> BRIDGE</a> <br>Bridge is a networking device which is use to divide a lan into multiple segment.
* Bridge works under DATA LINK LAYER of OSI Model.<br>
* Bridge stores the MAC address of PC available in a network.<br>
* Bridge use to reduce the traffic.

<a href="https://lms.clarusway.com/mod/lesson/view.php?id=1861&pageid=3826">FIREWALL</a><br>
A firewall is a system that is designed to prevent unauthorized access from entering a private network.<br>
A firewall is a network security system which is used to monitor and control the network traffic based on some predefined rules. Firewalls are the first line of defense and establish barriers between the internal and external networks in order to avoid attack from untrusted external networks. Firewalls can be either hardware, software or sometimes both.<br>
<img src="img/firewall.png" alt="firewall"><br>
Firewalls operate at multiple layers of the OSI model. Some firewalls can operate up to the Applicaton layer.


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMH4yGE73iQ">IDS-IPS</a><br>
Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) are very important in today’s networks. They are network security appliances that monitor networks and packets for malicious activity. An IDS is considered monitor mode and just records and tells you about problems, whereas an IPS can work in real-time to stop threats as they occur.<br>
Unklike IDS, IPS is able to actively block or prevent intrusions. It means IPS takes action:<br>
1- Inspection and Investigation<br>
2 - Action<br>
3- Logs and reports<br>
* Keep in mind, IDS and IPS are not necessarily two separate physical devices. Theny can be combined into one device.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpHLRc4Qt1E">LOAD BALANCING</a> <br>
Load balancers are servers that forward internet traffic to multiple servers(EC2 Instances) downstream.<br>
Why use a load balancer?<br>
* Spread load across multiple downstream instances.
* Expose a single point of access (DNS) to your application.
* Seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances.
* Do regular health checks to your instances.
* Provide SSL termination (HTTPS) for yor websites.
* Enforce stickiness with cookies.
* Hight availability across zones.
* Separate public traffic from private traffic.
<img src="img/Load_balancer.png" alt="Load Balancer">
** A Load balancer acts as the "traffic cop" sitting in foront of your servers and routing client requests across all servers capable of fulfilling those requests in a manner that maximizes speed and capacity utilization and ensures that no server is overworked, which could degrade performance. <br>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-oCTcf5k_0&t=18s"> PROXY SERVER </a><br>
A proxy server is basically a type of server that handles its client-machine requests by forwarding them on to other servers while allowing granular control over the traffic between the local LAN and the Internet. When it receives a request, the proxy will then connect to the specific server that can fulfill the request for the client that wants it. A proxy server operates at the Application layer.<br>
* Act as a gateway between you and the internet.
* Act as a firewall and web filter.
* Provides shared network connections
* Caches data to speed up common requests. 
* Provide privacy. 

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxBQZQM-RNk">VPN Concentrator</a><br>
Provides secure creation of VPN connections. A type of router device.It can:<br>
* Establish and configure tunnels.
* Authenticate users.
* Assign tunnel/IP addresses to users.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxVNhBsQxmY&t=186s">TCP/IP</a><br>
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol => is a set of network protocols(Protocol Suite)that enable communication between computers.<br>
* These protocols work together to provide an end-to-end connection by specifying how data should be segmented, addressed, and routed across networks. 
* Without TCP/IP protocol suite, there would be not Internet.  

<img src="img/TCP_IP_Suite.png" alt="TCP/IP Suite"><br>

TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol, and IP stands for Internet Protocol. TCP/IP is used for both a protocol suite and a networking Model. 
The TCP/IP suite, or simply the Internet protocol suite,  refers to a group of protocols used on modern networks. These protocols work together to provide an end-to-end connection by specifying how data should be segmented, addressed, and routed across networks.<br>

[NAT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wg8Hosr20yw)<br>
NAT ==> Network Address Translation
NAT is a process / technology where a router or a similar network device, translates one IP address into another IP address specifically, a router translates an internal host's private IP address into its public IP address for outgoing traffic and it also translates its public IP address to an internal private address for incoming traffic. <br>
NAT Benefits:<br>
- NAT improves security because internal hosts' IP addreses are hidden. 
- NAT, together with IPv4 private addressing scheme conserves IPv4 address space and thus extends its lifespan. <br>
4 TYPES OF NAT:<br>
- Static NAT(SNAT)
- Dynamic NAT(DNAT)
- PAT (Port Address Translation)
- Port Forwarding

[ARP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb1JA5CIssI)<br>
ARP is basically a program used by computer A to find computer B's MAC address based on its IP address.<br> 
- [How does a computer communicate locally and remotely?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb1JA5CIssI)<br>
- MAC address is used for local communications while IP address is used for remote communications.
- A switch, a layer 2 device is used for local communications, and default gateway, a layer 3 device, is used for remote communications.
-ARP is used in both situations.

[What is the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)?](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/learning/ddos/glossary/internet-control-message-protocol-icmp/)

The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a network layer protocol used by network devices to diagnose network communication issues. ICMP is mainly used to determine whether or not data is reaching its intended destination in a timely manner. Commonly, the ICMP protocol is used on network devices, such as routers. ICMP is crucial for error reporting and testing, but it can also be used in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.


[What is Nmap?](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-nmap-and-how-to-use-it-a-tutorial-for-the-greatest-scanning-tool-of-all-time/)

Nmap is short for Network Mapper. It is an open-source Linux command-line tool that is used to scan IP addresses and ports in a network and to detect installed applications.

Nmap allows network admins to find which devices are running on their network, discover open ports and services, and detect vulnerabilities.

[TCP - Three-way handshake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtP5ZB3wSk)

TCP stands for transmission control protocol. TCP is a reliable and connection-oriented transport protocol. With TCP, data can be delivered successfully and accurately. 
Many applications, such as web,  email, and FTP, use TCP. Before TCP transmits data, it will use three-way handshake to establish a connection. 
Step 1: The client sends a SYN segment to the server, asking for synchronization(connection).<br>
Step 2: The server replies with SYN-ACK (synchronization and acknowledgment). The server acknowledges the client's connection request. It also asks the client to open a connection too.<br>
Step 3: The client replies with ACK, which is like "Yes." Then the two-way connection is established between them.
