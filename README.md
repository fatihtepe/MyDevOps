[Template anatomy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-anatomy.html)
A template is a JSON- or YAML-formatted text file that describes your AWS infrastructure. The following examples show an AWS CloudFormation template structure and its sections.

[AWS::EC2::Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-ec2-instance.html)Specifies an EC2 instance.

If an Elastic IP address is attached to your instance, AWS CloudFormation reattaches the Elastic IP address after it updates the instance. For more information about updating stacks, see [AWS CloudFormation Stacks Updates.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks.html)

[CF-Conditions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/conditions-section-structure.html) The optional Conditions section contains statements that define the circumstances under which entities are created or configured.

[CF-Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/resources-section-structure.html) The required Resources section declares the AWS resources that you want to include in the stack, such as an Amazon EC2 instance or an Amazon S3 bucket.

[AWS resource and property types reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html) This section contains reference information for all AWS resource and property types that are supported by AWS CloudFormation.
