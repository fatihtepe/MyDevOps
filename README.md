[Template anatomy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-anatomy.html)
A template is a JSON- or YAML-formatted text file that describes your AWS infrastructure. The following examples show an AWS CloudFormation template structure and its sections.

[AWS::EC2::Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-ec2-instance.html)Specifies an EC2 instance.

If an Elastic IP address is attached to your instance, AWS CloudFormation reattaches the Elastic IP address after it updates the instance. For more information about updating stacks, see [AWS CloudFormation Stacks Updates.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks.html)

[CF-Conditions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/conditions-section-structure.html) The optional Conditions section contains statements that define the circumstances under which entities are created or configured.

[CF-Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/resources-section-structure.html) The required Resources section declares the AWS resources that you want to include in the stack, such as an Amazon EC2 instance or an Amazon S3 bucket.

[AWS resource and property types reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html) This section contains reference information for all AWS resource and property types that are supported by AWS CloudFormation.

[eksctl - The official CLI for Amazon EKS](https://eksctl.io/) eksctl is a simple CLI tool for creating and managing clusters on EKS - Amazon's managed Kubernetes service for EC2. It is written in Go, uses CloudFormation, was created by Weaveworks and it welcomes contributions from the community. Create a basic cluster in minutes with just one command: `eksctl create cluster`

As a technical person, I fetch some regular basis tasks. There are tasks that we can solve in several ways. Many tools, open-source programs, coding, or anything can be helpful in these cases.

## Work smarter, Not harder

--Mix--------------

We often need to go into the container to do some work, such as viewing logs, debugging, starting other processes, etc. There are two ways to enter a container: `attach` and `exec`.

[Docker Attach vs Exec](https://medium.com/geekculture/docker-two-ways-to-get-into-the-container-cda926c75fe)
The main differences between attach and exec are as follows:
attach goes directly to the terminal of the container startup command and does not start a new process.
exec opens a new terminal in the container and can start a new process.
